README_sea_ice_bs_core_lib	

These files were provided by Dave Douglas from the USGS and are used in the process of obtaining sea ice concentration (from passive microwave satellites) binary files from the NSIDC, converting the binary files to geotifs, and extacting the pixels of interest to SPEI, as defined in Petersen and Douglas 2004.

That process is described in the files:
